Nagios Vim Syntax
=================

Syntax file for Nagios in Vim. Forked from the [vim-scripts repository][1],
itself a mirror of the file by [Elan Ruusam√§e][2] hosted on the official Vim
site.

This way I can add it as a Pathogen bundle and submodule of my [dotfiles][3]
repository. This was forked to include `ftdetect` rules, which are missing from
the original repository. They're for the default install going into
`/usr/local/nagios`, or the Debian layout of `/etc/nagios3`. I'm happy to merge
others in if this is at all helpful to anyone.

Sorry, I'm not sure what the license terms are. This particular fork is by [Tom
